We may all have storage devices like SSDs, flash memory devices and SD cards of different capacities
but we might need a new storage device as they all get full with time but now we may not have to worry about their capacities as the Scientists at New York Genome Center have come up with a new way to encode digital data in DNA to create the highest density large scale data storage scheme ever invented. 
It is capable of storing 215 petabytes (215 million gigabytes) in a single gram of DNA(It means it could store every bit of datum ever recorded by humans in a container about the size and weight of a couple of pickup trucks) and it could potentially last for hundreds of thousands of years. 
Isn’t that cool?

## DNA DATA STORAGE
Every minute in 2018, Google conducted 3.88 million searches, and people watched 4.33 million videos on YouTube, sent 159,362,760 e-mails, tweeted 473,000 times and posted 49,000 photos on Instagram, according to software company Domo. 
By now(2020) an estimated 1.7 megabytes of data will be created per second per person globally, which translates to about 418 zettabytes in a single year (418 billion one-terabyte hard drive’s worth of information), assuming a world population of 7.8 billion. 
The magnetic or optical data-storage systems that currently hold this volume of 0s and 1s typically cannot last for more than a century, if that. 
Further, running data centers takes huge amounts of energy. In short, we are about to have a serious data-storage problem that will only become more severe over time.

<h3>Storage Limits</h3>
<p>Estimates based on bacterial genetics suggest that digital DNA could one day rival or exceed today&#8217;s storage technology.</p>

<p>DNA has many advantages for storing digital data.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is ultracompact.</li>
<li>It can last hundreds of thousands of years if kept in a cool, dry place.</li>
<li>As long as human societies are reading and writing DNA, they will be able to decode it.</li>
<li>DNA won’t degrade over time like cassette tapes and CDs, and it won’t become obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High cost.</li>
<li>DNA is significantly harder and slower to read than conventional computer transistors i.e., in terms of access speed it is actually less RAM-like than our average computer SSD or spinning magnetic hard-drive.</li>
</ul>
