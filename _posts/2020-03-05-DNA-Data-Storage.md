We may all have storage devices like SSDs, flash memory devices and SD cards of different capacities
but we might need a new storage device as they all get full with time but now we may not have to worry about their capacities as the Scientists at New York Genome Center have come up with a new way to encode digital data in DNA to create the highest density large scale data storage scheme ever invented. 
It is capable of storing 215 petabytes (215 million gigabytes) in a single gram of DNA(It means it could store every bit of datum ever recorded by humans in a container about the size and weight of a couple of pickup trucks) and it could potentially last for hundreds of thousands of years. 
Isn’t that cool?

## DNA DATA STORAGE
Every minute in 2018, Google conducted 3.88 million searches, and people watched 4.33 million videos on YouTube, sent 159,362,760 e-mails, tweeted 473,000 times and posted 49,000 photos on Instagram, according to software company Domo. 
By now(2020) an estimated 1.7 megabytes of data will be created per second per person globally, which translates to about 418 zettabytes in a single year (418 billion one-terabyte hard drive’s worth of information), assuming a world population of 7.8 billion. 
The magnetic or optical data-storage systems that currently hold this volume of 0s and 1s typically cannot last for more than a century, if that. 
Further, running data centers takes huge amounts of energy. In short, we are about to have a serious data-storage problem that will only become more severe over time.

<p>DNA has many advantages for storing digital data.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is ultracompact.</li>
<li>It can last hundreds of thousands of years if kept in a cool, dry place.</li>
<li>As long as human societies are reading and writing DNA, they will be able to decode it.</li>
<li>DNA won’t degrade over time like cassette tapes and CDs, and it won’t become obsolete.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>High cost.</li>
<li>DNA is significantly harder and slower to read than conventional computer transistors i.e., in terms of access speed it is actually less RAM-like than our average computer SSD or spinning magnetic hard-drive.</li>

## DNA PATTERN
An alternative to hard drives is progressing: DNA-based data storage. DNA—which consists of long chains of the nucleotides A, T, C and G—is life’s information-storage material. Data can be stored in the sequence of these letters, turning DNA into a new form of information technology. It is already routinely sequenced (read), synthesized (written to) and accurately copied with ease. DNA is also incredibly stable, as has been demonstrated by the complete genome sequencing of a fossil horse that lived more than 500,000 years ago. And storing it does not require much energy.

But it is the storage capacity that shines. DNA can accurately stow massive amounts of data at a density far exceeding that of electronic devices. The simple bacterium Escherichia coli, for instance, has a storage density of about 1019 bits per cubic centimeter, according to calculations published in 2016 in Nature Materials by George Church of Harvard University and his colleagues. At that density, all the world’s current storage needs for a year could be well met by a cube of DNA measuring about one meter on a side.

## CONCLUSION 
Among the challenges to making DNA data storage commonplace are the costs and speed of reading and writing DNA, which need to drop even further if the approach is to compete with electronic storage. Even if DNA does not become a ubiquitous storage material, it will almost certainly be used for generating information at entirely new scales and preserving certain types of data over the long term.
