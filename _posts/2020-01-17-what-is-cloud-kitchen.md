A cloud restaurant is a delivery-only food outlet, also known as dark kitchen/restaurant, ghost kitchen, and virtual restaurant. It is a food business, that is available on digital platforms like food ordering apps.

## What is the difference between a regular restaurant and a cloud kitchen?

Cloud restaurants operate as a production unit with a space for the preparation of food. Cloud kitchen provide no dine-in or takeaway facility. Customers can only order food from restaurant apps.

The reasons behind the overwhelming success of cloud kitchen concept are:

* Low investment cost
* Speed in service
* Customer feedback to better performance
* low infrastructure cost


With food aggregators like **Zomato, Swiggy & Uber Eats** taking complete responsibility of online deliveries, restaurants can now focus on just food as they don’t have to manage delivery boys or worry about expensive rentals & outlet rush. The cloud kitchen normally lists itself on third party apps and can have their own online ordering websites & apps (& save commissions).
